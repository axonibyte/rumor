## Self-test the oracle

An oracle is checked before it is trusted, in the same run that trusts it.
`tools/release-gate.py --self-test` drives twelve cases — one per refusal arm
plus a clean run — and asserts that **each arm fires alone**. The release-gate
workflow runs that self-test before the gate judges a pull request, because a
gate whose arms have stopped discriminating would otherwise refuse or admit a
run with nobody the wiser.

Firing *alone* is the property, not merely firing. Two arms that always fire
together cannot be told apart by any fixture, and the first draft of this gate
had two such pairs: an unchanged version also fails "not greater than the latest
tag", and a commit after the bump also leaves the head subject wrong. Both were
found by the self-test before a branch was cut, and both were repaired — one in
the arm, one in the fixture.

## Two oracles for any claim that matters

## Name what a test does not prove

A result carries its bound or it overstates itself. Three forms this project
holds to:

**A refusal set proves nothing about an exemption.** A gate that refuses
everything satisfies every refusal fixture, so a set of reds shows the gate is
loud rather than that it discriminates. The exemption needs a **positive
control** — an input the gate must pass — and the control must differ from the
nearest refusal fixture by exactly the thing under test. Differing in two things
makes two experiments and settles neither.

**An unmeasured arm is not a covered arm, and must say so.** Where
`tools/release-gate.py` cannot reach a verdict — `docs --check` with no
toolchain, say — it reports UNMEASURED on stderr rather than passing, and the
self-test prints which arms it could not drive. A check that quietly returns
clean when its instrument is missing is indistinguishable from one that passed.

**A fixture has no history, so drive the real thing as well.** Synthetic
fixtures are built to exercise an arm and therefore carry only what the arm
needs. Two defects in this gate were invisible to all twelve fixtures and
surfaced the moment it ran against a real accepted release:

- `git rev-parse <annotated tag>` returns the **tag object's** sha, not the
  commit's, so a comparison against a merge-base failed on a correctly rebased
  run. Every tag here is annotated by rule, so the unpeeled form was wrong for
  every base a real run would use. A fixture repo has no tags at all.
- Re-run after tagging, the tag **for the version being gated** counts as "the
  latest", and a correct run reads as going backwards.

Neither is reachable by building a better fixture. The rule is to drive a real
artifact that is already known-good, and to treat a refusal of it as a finding
about the gate until the gate's own reasoning says otherwise.
